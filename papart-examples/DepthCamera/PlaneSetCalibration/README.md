# Plane Set Calibration

This applications calibrates the kinect by setting the 3D position of the planar surface you want to make tactile (that can be a computer screen, a desk, wall...).

# How To
![interface](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/blob/master/papart-examples/DepthCamera/PlaneSetCalibration/planesetcalibration_interface)

The interface contains a slider PlaneUP (top left), a toggle button UseAR (left) and a Save button (bottom left).
You can also see 4 draggables items that represents the four angles of the calibrating sheet.

There are two modes: a mode using only the color camera feed, and a mode displaying the depth data from the kinect with color added.

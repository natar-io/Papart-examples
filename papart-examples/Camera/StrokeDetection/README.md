# Interface avec angles draggables pour définir la position manuelle des marqueurs

In this example we want to save a 3D position of a planar object. The position is manually set by the user.

## Inputs
First the user enters the real size of the object in the corresponding inputs in the top left hand corner (see bellow).

Once those parameters are set, the user can arrange the shape of the 3D position he wants to record.
The 1st corner is selected, and he can drag it on the corner of the real image. Then he can press the 2 key and grab the second corner and set it where he wants, and so on.

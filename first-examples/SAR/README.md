* [Table](Table): Simple touchscreen placed on the table. 
* [Gui](Gui): Touchscreen with AR user interface with Skatolo. Many different touch detections are used: finger tracking, colored objects, circular objects, markers, and the mouse. 
* [TouchDepthCalibrated](TouchDepthCalibrated): Depth points are displayed using the Camera/Projector calibration. 
* [Mapping](Mapping): Mapping on a 3D object.
* [MappingShader](MappingShader): Mapping on a 3D object, with pixel-based lighting (better quality).
* [PhysicalSlider](PhysicalSlider): Example of two TableScreen: one for sensing a circular shape and convert it to a value between 1 and 9. The other one displays the detection result.

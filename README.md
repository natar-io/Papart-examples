# Papart library examples

Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## PapARt 1.0 is out. 

The first big release is out. We look forward for feedback and issue reports. We will enhance the guides and create tutorials, and for this any help will be appreciated ! 

**2017 update: PapARt is now working on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.**

## Quick start guide

PapARt is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library, and it requires many other libraries to work. The smaller ones are included, and the heavy ones are separated.
Current version of Processing: 3.2.3 . Any higher version of Processing 3 should work. Processing 2, and 1 are not supported anymore.  

### Step 1 
* Download and install Processing  3.2.3.
* Run it once so that it creates a sketchbook folder (Processing folder for OSX and Windows).

### Step 2 
 
* Get the [PapARt library](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-default.tgz), or check out our [versions list]()https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/PapARt-versions).
* Get the [other libs](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/libraries.zip): a collection of libraries for math, network, 3D, and GUI. It includes well known Processing libraries: PeasyCam, OSCP5, Video, Toxiclibs. And custom ones: SVGExtended, ProcessingTUIO, Skatolo, GuiModes, and Reflections. 
* Get JavaCV for your platform [Windows](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-windows-x86_64.tgz), [Linux x86_64](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-linux-x86_64.tgz), [Mac OSX](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-macosx-x86_64.tgz). Experimental: [armhf / Raspberry pi](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-linux-armhf.tgz), [android](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-android-arm.tgz)

### Step 3 

Unpack and install **all** the libraries to your sketchbook/library directory. If you are not sure how to install a library follow the  [official processing guide](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library). 

### Step 4

It's ready to work ! You can try it with a [webcam](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/quick%20start%20webcam) for your first use.
